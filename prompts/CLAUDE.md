# CLAUDE.md

This directory contains prompts to kick off "larger" tasks with Claude. It should be used
instead of writing a giant prompt that contains all the instructions for the task.

Inclusion in the repository is also helpful to context about how a certain thing was built
or how it works later, for both humans and AI.
